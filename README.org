* Intro
This package can be used in one of two ways: purely to speed up some parts of org-roam, or to use org-node side-by-side with org-roam.

Either way, =org-node-cache-mode= must be enabled, and it's a good idea to go through the following config.

* Getting started

These settings help you feel at home using both org-roam and [[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node][org-node]] side-by-side:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-node-fakeroam-new-via-roam-capture)
(setq org-node-slug-fn #'org-node-fakeroam-slugify-via-roam)
(setq org-node-datestamp-format "%Y%m%d%H%M%S-")
#+end_src

Make sure the underlying org-id package knows about the files org-roam knows about.  You'd think it would, but that isn't a given!  Do either of these two:

1. Run =M-x org-roam-update-org-id-locations= every now and then.

2. Edit the following setting so it includes your =org-roam-directory=.  Supposing that is "~/org/", set this:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-node-extra-id-dirs '("~/org/"))
#+end_src

Finally, run =M-x org-node-reset= or just restart Emacs.  Now org-node's commands should function with minimum surprises.

* Bonus setup
** Speeding up the backlinks buffer

Enable this mode:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-node-fakeroam-fast-render-mode) ;; build the Roam buffer faster
#+end_src

Optionally, you can speed it up further by persisting on disk all the preview snippets.  The only reason it's not done by default is that it stores potentially world-readable text under "~/.emacs.d", and it's up to you to judge if that's a problem.

You might think that this only helps performance for someone who often restarts Emacs, but the nature of notes is such that you can go months between revisits of a given note, and it's /so nice/ for the buffer to still be instant instead of only near-instant.  YMMV; maybe your device is beefy enough anyway.

#+begin_src elisp
(org-node-fakeroam-setup-persistence) ;; cache previews on disk
#+end_src

** Speeding up the org-roam DB

If big files are slow to save, this section is for you.  We will turn off some org-roam stuff and instruct it to look up org-node tables.

PROVISO: if you use the [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] package, stop and reconsider!  As mentioned on the main README, the org-node tables only collect org-ref v3 citations that were within bracketed links that start with "cite", such as =[[citealt:&demski2019]]=, but NOT =[[fnotecite:&ioannidis2005]]= since it does not start with "cite", NOR =citealt:&fallenstein2015= since it is not wrapped in brackets.

------

First, let's stop the =org-roam-db-autosync-mode= from doing anything on save.  Either turn it off, or apply the following settings.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil) ;; don't update DB on save, not needed
(setq org-roam-link-auto-replace nil) ;; don't look for "roam:" links on save
#+end_src

If you turn it off, you may want to enable the following mode.  The autosync mode did a lot of unrelated things under one umbrella, such as this, which refreshes the visible Roam buffer when point moves into a different entry or the buffer changes.

#+begin_src elisp
(org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode) ;; autorefresh the Roam buffer
#+end_src

Now for the magic trick.  Enable one /or both/ of the following modes.

#+begin_src elisp
(org-node-fakeroam-db-feed-mode) ;; keep Roam DB up to date
(org-node-fakeroam-jit-backlinks-mode) ;; skip DB for Roam buffer
#+end_src

What do they do?  The *DB-Feed-Mode* keeps the org-roam DB up to date, by writing to it on save.  Use it if you have various Roam extensions that need the DB.  It should be fast, but may still not be instant on a large file.

If you do not need the DB, I recommend skipping it.

The *JIT-Backlinks-Mode* will generate backlinks for the Roam buffer out of org-node's tables, so that no DB is needed for this purpose.  That's right, you can even delete the org-roam.db file and the Roam buffer keeps on working!

** Misc
*** Tip: Rebuilding the Roam DB
If you often have reason to full-reset the DB, there is a faster command than =C-u M-x org-roam-db-sync=.  Try =M-x org-node-fakeroam-db-rebuild=.  Benchmark on my device:

- =C-u M-x org-roam-db-sync=: 179 seconds
- =M-x org-node-fakeroam-db-rebuild=: 6 seconds

Fair warning: a couple of data points will differ.

- (As mentioned earlier) Not all org-ref citations are picked up
- Files' recorded content-hash will be the blank string ""
- Files' recorded atime will be copied from the mtime
- Each node will record its =PROPERTIES= drawer as it exists on disk, but not implicit properties like =CATEGORY= or =TIMESTAMP_IA=

This is a place where I request contributions, since 6 seconds still seems a lot slower than it needs to be.  I envisioned running this function on every save -- that's obviously not possible yet.  The bottleneck seems to be in how EmacSQL is being called.

*** Tip: On very slow filesystems

I hear that on Termux on Android, filesystem access can be so slow that it's a pain to cycle dailies with org-roam ([[https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues/24#issuecomment-2278605819][11 seconds]] just to goto next daily!).  A Redditor also said Apple NFS is not ideal for Emacs.  Microsoft NTFS seems to have a reputation as well.

Good news.  You can override some functions to make them look up org-node tables and avoid the filesystem:

#+begin_src elisp
(advice-add #'org-roam-list-files :override
            #'org-node-fakeroam-list-files)

(advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--list-files :override
            #'org-node-fakeroam-list-dailies)

(advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p :override
            #'org-node-fakeroam-daily-note-p)
#+end_src

*** Tip: Word-wrap in the Roam buffer?
This has nothing to do with org-node, but I actually didn't know this for ages.

If you don't hard-wrap but prefer visual-line-mode or similar ([[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1862][org-roam#1862]]), you have to enable such modes yourself -- it sensibly doesn't inherit your Org hooks:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'org-roam-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
#+end_src
